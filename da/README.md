# Data Structure and Algorithm: read text and code together

Code runs on the machine. 

Program has its environment. The environment can bare-metal, RTOS, operating system of Linux or Windows, virtual machine, browser, or others. For example, V8 is open source JavaScript execution engine, which provides a high performance execution environment for JS code. Node.js is based on libuv written in C, and V8 is written in C++ for the most part.
 
Programming language is accompanied by its libraries. 

Progam is a concrete formulation of abstract algorithms on particular representations and structures of data. It is clear that the choice of algorithms and data structures are inseparably interwined. Practically, we choose data structures first, then apply and optimize the algorithms on the data.

If the combination of data structure and algorithm produces programs, how do we compose and analysize a program?

Compiler does parse the program text and transform it into machine code for a particular computing environment. Can we ask machine to write or to compose code? Can the machine find out the bugs and correct them?
 
## Type

Every constant, variable, expression, or function is of a certain type.

What is type? Type is a facility to create new type?

```
TYPE T = (c1, c2, ... , cn)
```
This is an enumeration type.

dynamic data structures: pointers, lists, trees, graphs/meshes, scatter table (hash codes)

Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Hashtables, Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Graphs

## Algorithm

primitive types and standard operators (assignment, comparison, arithmetic, logical, relational, bitwise, others)

sorting, search, graph, recursion (one generalization of repetition or iteration), 

linear search, binary search, fast string searching algorithm

priority search tree
